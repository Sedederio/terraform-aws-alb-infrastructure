- **Monitoring:** Get insights into your application's performance with CloudWatch integration.

## 🏗️ How It Works

This application uses Terraform to handle all configurations for AWS infrastructure. You do not need to write complex scripts. Instead, you can apply predefined modules that set up everything for you. 

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Directs incoming traffic to the right targets within your AWS setup.
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Creates a secure network for your resources.
- **Auto Scaling Groups:** Automatically adjust the number of active servers based on the current demand.

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps

Once you have downloaded the application files, you need to do a few simple setups before running them. 

1. **Unzip the Downloaded File:**
   - Locate the downloaded file and extract its contents to a folder on your computer.

2. **Set Up Your AWS Credentials:**
   - Ensure your AWS account credentials are configured properly by either exporting them as environment variables or using the AWS CLI.

3. **Run Terraform Commands:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where you extracted the files.
   - Initialize Terraform by running:
     ```
     terraform init
     ```
   - To apply the configuration and set up your infrastructure, run:
     ```
     terraform apply
     ```

4. **Check Your Setup:**
   - Once the process completes, log in to your AWS management console to verify that the infrastructure is created as expected.

## ❓ Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Error: Insufficient Permissions**  
  Ensure the AWS IAM user has the right permissions to create resources.

- **Error: Terraform Not Found**  
  Make sure that Terraform is installed and added to your PATH.

- **Error: AWS Credentials Not Found**  
  Double-check that your AWS credentials are correctly configured.
